  "例如：": "For example:",
  "在这个网站上，代理奖金是通过投注来计算的。例如，如果投注额为10-200000，则相应的奖金率为30/10000，如果投注额超过3000000，则代理奖金为30/10000。 A是该网站的代理商，他招募了B1、B2和B3作为他的代理商，B1也招募了C1和C2作为他的代理商。 B2 没有代理，B3 只有一名 C3 代理。": "On this site, agent bonuses are calculated through bets. For example, if the bet amount is 10-200000, the corresponding bonus rate is 30/10000, and if the bet amount exceeds 3000000, the agent bonus is 30/10000. A is the agent of the website. He recruits B1, B2 and B3 as his agents. B1 also recruits C1 and C2 as his agents. B2 has no agent and B3 has only one C3 agent.",
  "几天后，B1的有效投注为120000，B2的有效投注为40000，B3的有效投注为20000。C1的有效投注为100000，C2的有效投注为30000，C3的有效投注为3000000，所以B1的总成绩为C1+ C2=130000，代理人奖金率为30/10000。 B2无代理；因此，B2 的绩效为 0。B3 的总绩效为 C3 - 3000000，因此奖金率为 30/10000。 A直属战队的总业绩为180000+子代理3130000=3310000，因此奖金率为30/10000。": "A few days later, B1's effective bet is 120,000, B2's effective bet is 40,000, and B3's effective bet is 20,000. The effective bet of C1 is 100000, the effective bet of C2 is 30000, and the effective bet of C3 is 3000000, so the total score of B1 is C1+C2=130000, and the agent bonus rate is 30/10000. B2 has no agent; therefore, B2's performance is 0. The total performance of B3 is C3 - 3000000, so the bonus rate is 30/10000. The total performance of team A directly is 180,000 + sub-agents 3,130,000 = 3,310,000, so the bonus rate is 30/10,000.",
  "因此，奖金计算如下：": "Therefore, the bonus calculation is as follows:",
  "B1、B2、B3 对 A 的贡献：": "B1, B2, B3 contribute to A:",

  "由于B1的总演出数为13万，只有30/10000的折扣率，而A的总演出数为331万，折扣率为30/10000。那么A和B1的折扣差额为：30-30=0/10000，这个差额就是C1和C2为A贡献的部分，": "Since B1's total number of performances is 130,000, the discount rate is only 30/10,000, while A's total number of performances is 3.31 million, and the discount rate is 30/10,000. Then the discount difference between A and B1 is: 30-30=0/10000. This difference is the contribution of C1 and C2 to A.",

  "C3 为 A 做出贡献": "C3 contributes to A",
  "300 万 x 0/10000=": "3 million x 0/10000=",
  "由于C3的强大，A的整个业绩间接享受到了较高的折扣率。": "Due to the strength of c3, a's entire performance indirectly enjoys a higher discount rate.",
  "B2可以偷懒，没有下属的发展就没有优势。": "B2 can be lazy and has no advantage without the development of his subordinates.",
  "虽然B3加入比较晚，属于A的下属，但其下属的C3实力雄厚，让B3直接享受到了最高的折扣率。因此，无论B3加入时的职位如何，他的利益永远不会受到影响，他不会再遭受其他下属的损失，他的发展也不会受到限制。": "Although b3 joined relatively late and is a subordinate of a, its subordinate c3 is strong, allowing b3 to directly enjoy the highest discount rate. Therefore, regardless of b3's position when he joins, his interests will never be affected, he will no longer suffer losses from other subordinates, and his development will not be restricted.",
